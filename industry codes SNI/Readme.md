# Swedish Standard Industrial Classification (SNI)

## Overview

**SNI** (*Svensk Näringsgrensindelning*) is the Swedish Standard Industrial Classification system.  
It is used to classify companies and workplaces by the type of activity they carry out, enabling comparison across time, industries, and countries.

- Maintained by **Statistics Sweden (SCB)**  
- Aligned with the **EU’s NACE classification system**  
- Used in statistics, administration, and business registration  
- Companies may have **multiple SNI codes** if they operate in several areas

## Structure

SNI is hierarchical, with multiple levels of detail:

- **Sections** (1-letter codes, e.g. A = Agriculture)  
- **Divisions** (2 digits, e.g. 01 = Crop and animal production)  
- **Groups**  
- **Classes**  
- **Sub-classes / detailed groups**
